# Docker Best Practices

In this document, I outline the Docker best practices I applied in the Dockerfile for our Flask web application that displays the current time in Moscow. My focus has been on enhancing security, minimizing the image size, and ensuring the application runs with minimal privileges.

## 1. Multistage Builds

**Objective**: My goal was to reduce the final image size and minimize the attack surface by separating the build environment from the runtime environment.

**Implementation**:
- I utilized a two-stage build process. The first stage was used for preparing the application's dependencies. This approach allowed me to install and compile any necessary dependencies separately from the final image.
- In the final stage, I copied only the necessary artifacts (compiled dependencies and application code) from the build stage. This kept the final image clean of any build tools or leftover artifacts that are not needed at runtime.

**Benefits**:
- The image size was reduced because the final image contains only what is necessary for running the application.
- Security was enhanced since the build dependencies and tools are not present in the runtime environment, reducing the potential attack surface.

## 2. Running as a Non-Root User

**Objective**: I aimed to enhance the security of the Docker container by running the application as a non-root user.

**Implementation**:
- I created a dedicated user (`appuser`) in the Dockerfile for running the application.
- I used the `USER` directive to switch to `appuser` before starting the application.

**Benefits**:
- I mitigated security risks associated with running the container as the root user, which could potentially allow malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to the host system or other containers.
- I ensured compliance with best practices and security policies that restrict containers from running as root, making the application more portable across different environments with strict security requirements.

## 3. Minimal Base Image

**Objective**: I started with a minimal base image to further reduce the attack surface and image size.

**Implementation**:
- I selected `python:3.8-slim` as the base image, which is a minimal variant of the Python image optimized for size.

**Benefits**:
- The image size decreased, leading to faster build and deployment times.
- The number of pre-installed packages was reduced, minimizing the potential attack surface and the need for frequent security updates.

## 4. Exposing Only Necessary Ports

**Objective**: I aimed to limit the exposure of the application to only necessary network ports.

**Implementation**:
- I exposed only port `5000` using the `EXPOSE` directive, which is the port our Flask application uses.

**Benefits**:
- I minimized network exposure, reducing the risk of unauthorized access through unused or open ports.
- I clarified the network requirements of the application for maintainers and operators.

## Conclusion

By implementing these best practices, I've created a Dockerfile that prioritizes security, efficiency, and maintainability. This approach ensures that our Flask application is not only performant but also secured against common vulnerabilities and aligned with industry standards for containerized applications.
